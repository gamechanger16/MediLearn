# MediLearn
Rutgers Health Hackathon 2024 - Team 21


We uploaded main files that we used, but our XR solution was made with Unity building and deploying to HoloLens. Github only allows files up to 25MB at a time, we have our whole unity project in a .zip and .7z file with 3.5-5.0 GBs worth of data for all of our files. Because it is too large to upload to Github, we are uploading to Google Drive and are sharing link here for further viewing, testing and judging purposes.

Here are some individual files for you to see our progress and everything we have worked with, but in Google Drive, we have given you the whole Unity file so that you only have to download Unity and open our project right to experience what we experienced. 

Our solution can work in Unity editor or in HoloLens 2 mixed reality device, so even if you don't have the mixed reality device, you can still build and deploy and run it in Unity editor for your further viewing.
