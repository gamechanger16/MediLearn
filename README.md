# MediLearn
Rutgers Health Hackathon 2024 - Team 21


We uploaded main files that we used, but our XR solution was made with Unity building and deploying to HoloLens. Github only allows files up to 25MB at a time, we have our whole unity project in a .zip and .7z file with 3.5 GBs worth of data for all of our files. Because it is too large to upload to Github, we are uploading to Google Drive and are sharing link here for further viewing, testing and judging purposes.
